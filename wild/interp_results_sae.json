Did I miss any patterns in the text examples? Are there any more linguistic similarities?\n- Yes, all examples include the phrase multiple times reiterating its context (\"first come, first served\").\n\n(Part 2) Tokens that the neuron boosts in the next token prediction\n\nTop_logits: [\"etts\", \" Lak\", \"inese\", \"ikan\", \"abal\", \" quote\", \"Constructed\", \" Bard\", \"icol\", \" Ital\"]\nSIMILAR TOKENS: The logits don't provide any immediately obvious pattern.\n\nCombining the activation patterns with the top logits which seem unrelated, we mainly rely on the activation pattern itself.\n\n[EXPLANATION]: The neuron activates on the token \"first\" within the formulaic expression \"first come, first served basis\".", "interpretation": "The neuron activates on the token \"first\" within the formulaic expression \"first come, first served basis\".", "f1_score": 1.0}, {"feature_index": 987, "analysis": "## Part 1\n\nStep 1: List a couple of activating and contextual tokens you find interesting. \n\nACTIVATING TOKENS: \">>\", \">>\", \">>\"\n\nStep 2: Write down general shared features of the text examples.\n\n- The activating tokens are consistently the double closing angle brackets \">>\".\n- The text context involves listings or itemizations, such as inventories from a game or structured text.\n\n## Part 2\n\nSIMILAR TOKENS: \" derail\", \"PART\", \" cour\", \"FFER\", \"prising\", \"achu\", \"\u05bc\", \"ither\", \" Hobby\", \"pires\"\n\nWhat do these have in common?\n- The top logits contain strings that suggest truncation or partial tokens and could facilitate the completion or continuation of words/phrases.\n\nCombining observations from Part 1 and Part 2:\n\n- The text contexts are listings or inventories using \">>\" to denote separation between items or characteristics.\n- The activating token \">>\" likely signifies a transition or continuation point within structured data.\n- The logits suggested are diverse yet seem usable in contexts where the neuron might be attempting to predict the next item or element in a list.\n\n[EXPLANATION]: Neuron activates on double closing angle brackets \">>\" used within structured text to denote continuation or transition points within listings or itemizations.", "interpretation": "Neuron activates on double closing angle brackets \">>\" used within structured text to denote continuation or transition points within listings or itemizations.", "f1_score": 0.873015873015873}, {"feature_index": 988, "analysis": "### NEURON INTERPRETATION ###\n\n(Part 1) Tokens that the neuron activates highly on in text\n\nExample 1: \" style =\" margin : 0 px 0 px 0 px 0 . 8 ex ; padding - left : 1 ex ; border - left - color : rgb <<(>> 204 , 204 , 204\n\nExample 2: isol Team 0 : 32 : 57 115 R\u00e9 mi P aur iol ( Fra ) FD J - Big Mat 0 : 33 : 15 116 Michael Matthews ( <<A>> us ) Rab ob ank\n\nExample 3: with mix - matched eyes . \" Because I want to ,\" he responded . \" That should be enough , right ?\"   S age sighed and got <<to>> his feet . \" Sure\n\nExample 4: It a ) Omega Pharma - Quick step 56 Angel Mad raz o ( Sp a ) Mov istar Team 57 Gu illa ume Le var let ( Fra ) <<Saur>> - So jas un 58\n\n\nStep 1.\nACTIVATING TOKENS: \"( <<A>> us )\", \"<<to>>\", \"<<(>>\".\nPREVIOUS TOKENS: \"Mat 0\", \" eyes .\", \"color:\".\n\nThe activation tokens seem to either be punctuation marks or single characters within parentheses or sequences.\n\nStep 2.\n- The neuron activates on various punctuation marks or single characters within sequences.\n- Context can include technical/mathematical notation or mid-sentence segments.\n\nLet me look again for more patterns.\n- Yes, the activated tokens are often part of lists, sequences, or formatting, particularly those involving technical data or written communication structures such as HTML and data inside parentheses.\n\n(Part 2) Tokens that the neuron boosts in the next token prediction\n\nTop_logits: [\"RFC\", \"GET\", \"HR\", \" exemplary\", \" cour\", \" derail\", \"liest\", \"Best\", \"SL\", \"auer\"]\n\nSIMILAR TOKENS: \"RFC\", \"GET\", \"HR\", \"SL\", \"auer\"\n- The top logits list includes acronyms, technical terms, and proper nouns.\n\n[EXPLANATION]: The neuron activates on tokens within lists, sequences, technical notations, and formatted text structures, often involving punctuation or single characters.", "interpretation": "The neuron activates on tokens within lists, sequences, technical notations, and formatted text structures, often involving punctuation or single characters.", "f1_score": 0.873015873015873}]
